# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Adding a New Employee

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeController.ts`,  14 
- **Objective:** To inspect the flow of data when adding a new employee and ensure the employee is being correctly added through the service.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `req.body`: Contains the data sent in the POST request (new employee details). For example: `{ name: 'John Doe', department: 'HR', role: 'Manager' }`.
  - `newEmployee`: Should be identical to `req.body` unless transformed or validated.
  - `createdEmployee`: This is the result from `employeeService.addEmployee(newEmployee)`. You should inspect its value to confirm the employee has been created and stored correctly.

- **Call Stack:**
  - The stack should lead to the `addEmployee` function call in `employeeController.ts`, then to `employeeService.addEmployee(newEmployee)` in the service file.
  
- **Behavior:**
  - If no errors occur, the function should proceed to send a `201` status with a success message and the `createdEmployee` data.
  - If an error is thrown, the function should proceed to catch the error and send a `500` status with an error message.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The breakpoint shows how the request data is passed into the controller and passed on to the service layer.
  - It helps confirm that the `newEmployee` data is correctly received and processed by the `addEmployee` method in the service.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - If `createdEmployee` is `null` or `undefined`, this could indicate that the `employeeService.addEmployee()` method failed to add the employee.
  - Possible causes include incorrect database configuration, a bug in the service, or issues with how the employee data is being validated or processed.

- **Are there areas for improvement?**
  - Add more specific error handling to return different status codes based on the type of failure (e.g., validation errors, database connection issues).
  - Validate the input data before calling `addEmployee` to ensure the data is properly structured and contains the required fields.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario emphasizes the importance of correctly passing request data and handling potential errors in the service layer.
  - It also reinforces the need for thorough validation and testing to ensure that API functionality works as intended.


## Scenario 2: Updating an Existing Employee

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeController.ts`, 23
- **Objective:** To inspect how the employee data is updated and ensure the updated employee information is correctly processed and saved.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `id`: This should contain the `id` of the employee to be updated (from the `req.params`). For example: `12345`.
  - `updatedData`: This should contain the updated data sent in the request body. For example: `{ name: 'Jane Doe', department: 'Finance', role: 'Senior Manager' }`.
  - `updatedEmployee`: This is the result from the `employeeService.updateEmployee(id, updatedData)` call. It should reflect the updated employee data.

- **Call Stack:**
  - The stack should show that the call reaches the `updateEmployee` function in the controller and then proceeds to the `updateEmployee` method in the service.

- **Behavior:**
  - If the employee is successfully updated, the response will return a `200` status with the updated employee data.
  - If any error occurs (e.g., employee not found, database issues), the function should catch the error and return a `500` status.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The breakpoint helps you observe the values of `id` and `updatedData` that are passed to the `updateEmployee` function.
  - It also confirms if the `updatedEmployee` is returned correctly after the update operation in the service.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - If `updatedEmployee` is `null` or `undefined`, this might suggest the employee does not exist in the database or the update operation failed.
  - Another possibility is that the `id` is not being correctly parsed or used in the database query, leading to an unsuccessful update.

- **Are there areas for improvement?**
  - Consider adding more validation to check if the employee exists before attempting the update.
  - Improve error handling by sending specific error messages (e.g., `Employee not found` if no employee is found with the given `id`).

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario highlights how the controller interacts with the service to update data and confirms the role of validation in ensuring that updates are performed correctly.
  - It also emphasizes the importance of handling missing or invalid data gracefully to improve the robustness of the API.


## Scenario 3: Retrieving Employees for a Specific Branch

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeController.ts`, 65
- **Objective:** To inspect how the employee data is retrieved for a specific branch and ensure the correct employees are returned or appropriate error messages are triggered.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `branchId`: This should contain the branch ID from the request parameters .
  - `employees`: This should be the array of employees returned from the `employeeService.getEmployeesForBranch(branchId)` method. It will either contain employee data or be an empty array if no employees are associated with the branch.
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The stack should show that the `getAllEmployeesForBranch` function is called, followed by a call to the service layer (`employeeService.getEmployeesForBranch(branchId)`) to retrieve the employees.

- **Behavior:**
  - If `employees` contains data, the response will return a `200` status with the list of employees.
  - If `employees` is empty, the response will return a `404` status with a message indicating no employees were found for the given branch.
  - If an error occurs (e.g., invalid `branchId` or a service/database error), a `500` status with an error message will be returned.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The breakpoint helps you confirm that the correct `branchId` is passed into the controller and used in the database query to fetch employees.
  - It shows how the service handles the query and either returns employees or an empty array if no employees are found.
  
- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - If the `employees` array is empty, it suggests that no employees are linked to the provided `branchId` in the database. This could happen if:
    - The `branchId` does not exist in the database.
    - The database query might be incorrect or not matching the branch to employees.
  - If no employees are returned despite the branch ID existing, ensure the relationship between employees and branches is correctly set up in the database.

- **Are there areas for improvement?**
  - You might want to add more validation or checks to confirm that the `branchId` exists before querying the employees.
  - Consider enhancing error handling by returning more specific error messages, especially for invalid or non-existent `branchId`.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario underscores the importance of validating input parameters like `branchId` and ensuring they are used correctly in queries.
  - It highlights the significance of handling empty or missing data gracefully and the need to return clear messages when no results are found.


## Scenario 4: Creating a New Branch

- **Breakpoint Location:** `branchService.ts`, 5  
- **Objective:** To inspect how the branch data is handled when creating a new branch and ensure the branch is correctly created in Firestore.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `branchData`: Contains the data sent in the POST request (new branch details). For example: `{ name: 'New Branch', location: 'City Center' }`.
  - `newBranch`: The result returned from `branchRepository.createBranch(branchData)`. You should inspect its value to confirm the branch has been created and stored correctly.

- **Call Stack:**
  - The stack should lead to the `addBranch` function call in `branchService.ts`, then to the `branchRepository.createBranch(branchData)` call to add the branch in Firestore.

- **Behavior:**
  - If no errors occur, the function should return the created branch data.
  - If an error occurs (e.g., database issues, validation failures), the function should throw an error with a message indicating the failure.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - This breakpoint helps confirm how the request data is passed and whether the branch is successfully created in Firestore.
  
- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - If `newBranch` is `null` or `undefined`, it suggests a failure in creating the branch, which could be due to issues in the Firestore database or improper request handling.
  
- **Are there areas for improvement?**
  - Add validation before attempting to create the branch to ensure data integrity.
  - Improve error handling by providing detailed error messages to clarify the root cause of the failure.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario emphasizes the importance of input validation and error handling when creating resources in the system.

## Scenario 5: Adding a New Employee

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeService.ts`, 32  
- **Objective:** To inspect the process of adding a new employee and ensure the employee is correctly added through the service with duplicate checks.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `employeeData`: Contains the data sent in the POST request (new employee details).
  - `existingEmployeeByEmail`: The list of all employees fetched to check for email or phone duplicates.
  - `duplicate`: Boolean value indicating if there’s a duplicate email or phone.

- **Call Stack:**
  - The stack should lead to the `addEmployee` function call, then to the duplicate check and `employeeRepository.createEmployee(employeeData)`.

- **Behavior:**
  - If no duplicates are found, the employee is added, and the `newEmployee` data is returned.
  - If a duplicate is found, a string indicating the duplication issue is returned.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The breakpoint confirms how the system checks for duplicate employees before adding a new one and ensures that no duplicate entries exist in the database.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - If `existingEmployeeByEmail` is not being populated correctly, it could result in false negatives when checking for duplicates.
  
- **Are there areas for improvement?**
  - The duplicate check can be optimized by using more efficient database queries rather than fetching all employees.
  - Return more specific error messages when duplicates are found to help users understand the issue.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario highlights the importance of performing pre-save validation, especially when working with potentially conflicting data like emails and phone numbers.

---

## Scenario 6: Validating Employee Request Data

- **Breakpoint Location:** `validateRequest.ts`, 8 
- **Objective:** To inspect how request validation is being performed and ensure validation errors are being handled correctly.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `schema`: The Joi schema used to validate the incoming request data.
  - `error`: The result of the schema validation, containing details about any validation issues.
  - `req.body`: The request body that is being validated.

- **Call Stack:**
  - The stack should lead to the `validateRequest` function, which checks the request body against the provided schema.

- **Behavior:**
  - If validation passes, the next middleware is called, and the request proceeds to the next step.
  - If validation fails, a `400` status is returned with the validation error details.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - This breakpoint helps verify that validation is correctly processing the request body and catching any validation issues before the request is passed along.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - If `error` is `null`, it could mean the schema validation failed to catch a problem, or the schema itself might not be applied correctly.
  
- **Are there areas for improvement?**
  - Ensure that all required fields are being properly validated, and consider adding custom error messages for clarity.
  - Optimize the error logging to provide more useful information when validation fails.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario demonstrates the importance of input validation in maintaining data integrity and preventing bad data from entering the system.

## Scenario 3: CORS Configuration

- **Breakpoint Location:** `app.ts` at line `18` (`app.use(cors());`)
- **Objective:** To ensure that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured properly and restricts API access to only trusted domains.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**  
  - `cors()` is used with default settings (which allows all domains).  
  - No specific origin restriction applied.
- **Call Stack:**  
  1. `app.ts` line 35: `app.use(cors());`
- **Behavior:** CORS is not restricting any domains because the default settings are being used, which allows all origins to make requests.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - I learned that the CORS middleware is allowing requests from any domain by default.
- **Did you observe
